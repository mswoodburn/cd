## Data model

### Folder structure

In order to have all modifications to the draft data model more traceable, the model is split up in separate spreadsheets. This folder contains the summary of the CD draft standard.

For each of the dimensions that need further specification, a sub folder was created containing a dedicated spreadsheet to elaborate the definition.

### Committing changes

When committing changes to one of the spreadsheets (or adding a new definition), please make sure that you describe as detailed as possible the changes in the commit message.
This template can be used to structure the commit message:
* What?
  Add here a detailed description of the modification that was done (e.g. Definition XYZ was changed from 'text1' to 'text2')
* Why?
  Describe the reasoning behind the change.
* Impact?
  When there is an impact on other parts of the standard, please describe it here.
  
A detailed tracking of the changes will greatly benefit the quality of the documents! 

Another route to change a document or start a discussion is to open a new issue. If the impact of your modification is large, it is generally a good idea to raise an issue first.
